PLoS ONE 13(7): e0201016. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201016

A de-identified dataset of patient visits is available on the Github repository (https://github.com/yaleemmlc/admissionprediction).

## Code
EDA.ipynb - Exploratory Data Analysis - Use exploratory data analysis for feature selection, original dataset contains over 900 variables.  
ED_Admit_Analysis.ipynb - Modeling Analysis - Use train/test split and cross validation to test and select classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, etc),
measure results, and determine feature importance.
